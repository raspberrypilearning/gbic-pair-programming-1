### Pair Programming and girls

The premise of the 'Pair Programming' teaching approach project is that the way in which computing is taught may not always match the teaching approaches that girls are most likely to respond positively to ([Goode et al., 2006](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Lost-in-Translation%3A-Gender-and-High-School-Science-Goode-Estrella/787d7aa31ca0bc201c22597170931e4d2987352c)). 

So why is Pair Programming thought to be good for girls?
+ It encourages in-class interactive engagement in learning
+ It enhances cooperative problem-solving and communication in the classroom among the pupils
+ Some research suggests women perform better when they are able to articulate their thoughts verbally, while men perform better when their learning experience is structured

The more collaborative and discursive approach to computing encouraged through Pair Programming does seem to have benefits for female pupils. Research conducted at university level has reported that using Pair Programming increases problem-solving confidence in women more than for men ([McDowell et al., 2006](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1145287.1145293)). Research in schools suggests that collaborative problem-solving increases persistence in girls when they encounter difficulties ([Werner & Denning 2009](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15391523.2009.10782540)). There is no evidence to suggest that the approach has a negative impact on boys.
