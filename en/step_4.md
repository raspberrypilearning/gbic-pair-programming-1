## The Pair Programming approach

Pair Programming is an approach where two people work together to write a program or solve a problem whilst sharing a single computer. It was first developed in the software industry. It soon came to education as the observed benefits became clear.

Application of the Pair Programming concept is more structured than simply asking two learners to work together. Pairing learners without giving guidance as to how you want them to work together can often lead to one, or both, learners quickly losing focus. One of the clear aims of Pair Programming is to make sure that both learners are engaged and contributing equally, whilst also reducing the  demands associated with tackling a coding task independently.

### The Driver and the Navigator

In their pairs, pupils take turns being the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver controls the keyboard and mouse and types in the code, while the Navigator reads the instructions, supports the Driver by watching out for errors in the code, and thinks strategically about next steps and solutions to problems. Pupils should swap roles regularly (every 5-10 minutes). This ensures that everyone is contributing equally and actively to the collaborative learning.

The focus on specific aspects of the task benefits both learners by reducing the task demands:
+ the Driver can concentrate on code accuracy, rather than problem solving or deciphering instructions
+ the Navigator can take a broader view of the task and how best to solve problems
+ both learners will practice thinking in different ways and will take ownership of the problem that they are solving

### Introducing the Pair Programming roles to your pupils

The Pair Programming approach is different to the type of pair work that your pupils will be used to. It's really important that they understand why they are using this approach and what is expected of them in their different roles. The first lesson that you will teach as part of the project takes the time to introduce Pair Programming and encourages pupils to come up with ground rules for working together. They also practice swapping roles during a programming task and talk about the benefits of Pair Programming on their work. Watch the video below to see some of this lesson in action with a Year 6 class who took part in our pilot project last year.
